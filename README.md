HPAC
====

Github Test for HPAC - Github is a distributed revision control system, allowing a disbursed group to collabote in an unlimited manner, without any loss of control of a canonical version of content/policy. Especially useful when needing "official" standard documentation (e.g. policy), but also wishing for continuous improvement and development of said documentation.
